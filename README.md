# Using-I2P-On-Android

## **Step One:** Getting an I2P Router(I2P for Android)

I2P for Android follows the same release schedule of as the I2P Desktop
application. There are three "Official" places to get I2P for Android. The big
difference between each platform is how you get updates. 

 - [I2P for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.i2p.android) Google Play Downloads

With the Google Play downloads, you'll get updates from Google automatically, usually about 6 hours
after I upload them to Google Play Store.

 - [I2P for Android](https://f-droid.i2p.io) F-Droid Downloads

With F-Droid, new updates become available when I upload them to the downloads
server, which usually takes about 20 minutes to an hour.

 - [I2P for Android](https://download.i2p2.de/android/current/app.apk) Freestanding APK Downloads

When using a Freestanding APK, you'll need to update the application
manually.

## **Step Two:** Configure a Browser(IceRaven)

You'll need to get a browser which can use I2P as well. There are several browsers
for Android but almost all of them are quite difficult to configure safely and
correctly.
